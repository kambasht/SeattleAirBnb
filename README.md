**## Installation**

No external libraries are required to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

**## Project Motivation**

The motivation for the project was to analyze the 2016 Seattle AirBnb dataset to better understand:
 1. The cheapest and the most expensive neighborhoods in Seattle
 2. Which time of the year would be the best time to visit Seattle?
 3. Should I prefer booking my AirBnb with a super host?
 4. What factors contributed the most towards being a super host?
 5. What factors in an AirBnb listing contributed to its price?
 
**## File Descriptions**

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase my work related to the above questions. The notebook follows the CRISP-DM process of understanding the business and the data, preparation of data, modelling and consequently, model evaluation. Markdown cells have been used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

**## Results**

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](www.google.com).

**## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements**
